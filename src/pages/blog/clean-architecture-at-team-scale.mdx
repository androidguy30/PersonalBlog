When your org scales, **seams** matter more than modules. This post outlines a
playbook for aligning teams on boundaries, contracts, and shared libraries.

## Principles
- Stable interfaces at domain boundaries.
- Contracts over conventions.
- Testing pyramids per boundary.

## Tools
- Architectural linting (dep rules).
- Versioned shared packages.
- Change data capture for cross-service evolution.
