**TL;DR:** Joining the rotation once a quarter improved empathy and sped up incident resolution.

## The problem
We had long resolution times and too many noisy alerts.

## The fix
- Simple rotation with clear escalation rules.
- After-action reviews that focus on learning, not blame.
- Runbooks close to code, versioned with the service.

## Takeaways
1. You can't manage what you don't feel.
2. Incident data is product feedback.
3. Blameless culture unlocks velocity.
