The best CI is **invisible**â€”it nudges, safeguards, and rarely blocks.

## What worked for us
- PR-based preview builds.
- Caching that actually hits (module granularity).
- Flake budget + quarantine lanes.

## Guardrails
- Required checks should be **few and meaningful**.
- Fast feedback trumps exhaustive gates on every commit.
