  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm {AUTHOR.name},I started my career at YourStory, where I got early exposure to India’s startup ecosystem and how products are built and scaled. That experience shaped my interest in solving real problems through technology and building systems that are simple, reliable, and user-focused.Over the years, I’ve worked across multiple consumer and fintech platforms, building mobile apps and SDKs that serve millions of users. My work has spanned Android, iOS, React Native, and Kotlin Multiplatform, along with deep integrations in payments and security. Today, I’m an Engineering Manager focused on mobile architecture, platform security, and developer experience. At Constantinople, I led key initiatives across multi-tenant mobile apps, banking SDKs, and Apple Wallet/UPI integrations—while mentoring engineers and shaping engineering practices across teams. I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering, product, and design, and I’m driven by a simple goal: build high-quality systems, solve complex problems with clarity, and help teams do their best work..</p>
