  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>I'm <strong>Kausthubh Adhikari</strong>.</p>

<p>
  I started my career at <strong>YourStory</strong>, where I got early exposure to India’s startup ecosystem 
  and how products are built and scaled. That experience shaped my interest in solving real problems through technology and building systems that are 
  <strong>simple</strong>, <strong>reliable</strong>, and <strong>user-focused</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Over the years, I’ve worked across multiple <strong>consumer</strong> and <strong>fintech</strong> platforms, 
  building <strong>mobile apps</strong> and <strong>SDKs</strong> that serve millions of users.My work has spanned <strong>Android</strong>, <strong>iOS</strong>, <strong>React Native</strong>, and 
  <strong>Kotlin Multiplatform</strong>, along with deep integrations in 
  <strong>payments</strong> and <strong>security</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  Today, I’m an <strong>Engineering Manager</strong> focused on 
  <strong>mobile architecture</strong>, <strong>platform security</strong>, and 
  <strong>developer experience</strong> at <strong>Constantinople</strong>. I led key initiatives across 
  <strong>multi-tenant mobile apps</strong>, <strong>banking SDKs</strong>, and 
  <strong>Apple Wallet/UPI integrations</strong>—while mentoring engineers and 
  shaping engineering practices across teams.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy working at the intersection of <strong>engineering, product, and design</strong>, 
  and I’m driven by a simple goal: <strong>build high-quality systems</strong>, 
  <strong>solve complex problems with clarity</strong>, and 
  <strong>help teams do their best work</strong>.
